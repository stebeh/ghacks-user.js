A `user.js` is a configuration file that can control hundreds of Firefox settings. For a more technical breakdown and explanation, you can read more on the [overview](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/1.1-Overview) wiki page.

The `ghacks user.js` is a **template**, which, as provided, aims to provide as much privacy and enhanced security as possible, and to reduce tracking and fingerprinting as much as possible - while minimizing any loss of functionality and breakage (but it will happen).

Everyone, experts included, should at least read the [implementation](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/1.3-Implementation) wiki page, as it contains important information regarding a few `ghacks user.js` settings.

Literally thousands of sources, references and suggestions. That said...

* Martin Brinkmann at [ghacks](https://www.ghacks.net/) <sup>1</sup>
* The ghacks community and commentators
* [12bytes](http://12bytes.org/tech/firefox/firefoxgecko-configuration-guide-for-privacy-and-performance-buffs)
   * The 12bytes article now uses this user.js and supplements it with an additonal JS hosted right [here](https://github.com/atomGit/Firefox-user.js) at github

<sup>1</sup> The ghacks user.js was an independent project by [Thorin-Oakenpants](https://github.com/Thorin-Oakenpants) started in early 2015 and was [first published](https://www.ghacks.net/2015/08/18/a-comprehensive-list-of-firefox-privacy-and-security-settings/) at ghacks in August 2015. With Martin Brinkmann's blessing, it will keep the ghacks name.

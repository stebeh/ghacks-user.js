    to use ghacks-user.js to control prefs (can't say enough how comprehensively awesome this is),
    to use uBlock Origin (hands down my fav extension) to cut down on scripting (denied everywhere by default),

    to allow Firefox's privacy.resistFingerprinting config along with the ongoing implementation of the Tor Uplift project to take care of the spoofing and fingerprinting protection that RAS used to handle
